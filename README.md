Got annoyed with computing Christoffel symbols, Riemann tensors, and Ricci tensors while working out of Schutz's A First Course in General Relativity so wanted to develop code that would derive their components for me with the SymPy library.

Though I have code that can derive many of the tensors encountered in an introductory class on general relativity, I can't seem to get many correct answers. I still have lots of bugs in this code somewhere and I currently can't figure out where.
